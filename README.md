> I am using React Navigation with Stack, React Native Reanimated, and Expo Linear Gradient. I started this project after lunch at 13:00 (Jakarta Time) and finished it by 21:00. While I considered implementing a better transition between the home page and the detail page, I prioritized time constraints and focused on completing the project and creating content that I love. Overall, I enjoyed working on this homework project. Thank you for the opportunity!

Here is the page :

- Home Page & Slider Carousel
